Computer Vision Developer and Researcher, holding a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from CIn-UFPE and currently pursuing a Master's degree in Continual Learning for Image Classification, I'm particularly interested in topics such as Image Super-Resolution, Image Synthesis, and Representation Learning.

In my current role, I work on projects involving Image Classification, Object Detection and Tracking. I'm experienced in using Python and several key libraries for machine learning and deep learning, including PyTorch, PyTorch Lightning, Avalanche, Optuna, MLflow, Numpy, and Pandas.

If you're looking for someone with understanding of computer vision, backed by both academic and professional experience, please don't hesitate to connect with me. I'm speak both Portuguese and English, and I look forward to collaborate with colleagues from around the world.
